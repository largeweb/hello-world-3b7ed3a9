<analysis>Analyzing the tracker for the Hello, World! project. The project consists of only one page that displays "Hello, World!" centered on the screen. Tailwind CSS will be used for styling and no interactivity is needed.</analysis>
<reasoning>The tracker specifies that `src/app/page.tsx` should render the "Hello, World!" text centered on the screen using Tailwind CSS. There are no props, state management, API calls or animation required. The `Edge runtime` is also specified as not applicable, so no 'use client' or export const runtime is necessary.</reasoning>
